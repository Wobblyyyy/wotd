# Ineffable (adjective)
1. too great or extreme to be expressed or described in words

> Among the many shortcomings of modern natural languages is that ideas
> of complex philosophy are often rendered ineffable.

Ineffable, although plain in nature, is an excellent alternative to variants
of "inexpressible," "indescribable," and/or "unimaginable." Think of it like
a stronger version of any of those aforementioned words.

The concept of ineffability is well-known to anyone with experience in a very
niche field: philosophy was the example used previously, but mathematics,
programming, and even music often deal with abstract concepts that are very
difficult to formulate into a string of words.
