# Mellifluous (adjective)
1. (of a voice or words) sweet or musical; pleasant to hear

> One of the characteristics of fantastic writing is a mellifluous voice.

A word I discovered rather recently, "mellifluous," much like "quintessential,"
is, in a sense, autological. The word "mellifluous" is mellifluous: need I
say much more?
