# Variegate (verb)
1. alter in appearance, especially by adding different colors

> A hallmark of maintaining a good sense of style is to variegate the way
> you present yourself - wearing the same outfit every day, even if it's a nice
> outfit, conveys a lack of imagination and a lack of care about your own
> appearance.

2. make more diverse or varied

> It's difficult to become a successful musician without variegating your
> repertoire. This variegation is key to versatility as a player.

I'll be honest - I may or may not have stolen this word from my sister. Have
you ever seen a leaf that appears discolored around the edges? This attribute
characterizes the leaf as "variegated." I don't have much reason for choosing
this word, save the fact that it just looks cool.
