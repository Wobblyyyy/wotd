# Cynosure (noun)
1. a person or thing that is the center of attention or admiration

> The chandelier stood out to anyone who entered the spacious ballroom -
> artistically crafted from dozens upon dozens of minuscule pieces of glass,
> it was an archetypal cynosure.

My reason for choosing this word stems from its similarity to the prefix
"cryo," which is, without a doubt, among the coolest prefixes to grace the
English language. This word isn't used very frequently - its usage declined
during the 19th and 20th centuries and it is only recently seeing a resurgence
in usage.
